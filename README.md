# Movies-Recommendation-Project


This project implements a movie recommendation system using **Cosine Similarity**, **CountVectorizer**, and basic **Data Preprocessing** techniques. The system provides movie recommendations based on user preferences or movie descriptions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for the project.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms like Cosine Similarity and CountVectorizer.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** (optional): For visualizing data and results.

## Features

- **Movie Recommendations**: Recommend movies based on similarity scores between movies.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Calculate the similarity between movie descriptions.
- **CountVectorizer**: Convert movie descriptions into numerical format for similarity comparison.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the movie dataset for better results.
